				<p class="about"> Megha Jain has an extensive background in environmental policy. Her previous role at the Urban Green Council involved
				working with the New York City Mayor's Office of Sustainability to analyze buildings' energy and water use. Through that experience, she became
				interested in data science and in thinking about how the data collection process and implicit biases can impact analyses. </p>
				<p class="about"> In order to learn about the growing field of data science, she enrolled in a bootcamp through

				After completing this course, she worked at Lotik, a startup developing a low-cost sensor to monitor water usage at point-of-use, to continue exploring how data could be used to serve environmental interests. Currently, she works at a nonprofit DoSomething.org, where she uses data to help build a digital platform to encourage youth volunteerism and civic engagement.
